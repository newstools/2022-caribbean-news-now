French elections: Will Macron get majority?				




France has begun voting in the first round of parliament elections key to Emmanuel Macron’s second term.



Less than two months after reelection, Macron faces a strong challenge from a united left-wing bloc that polls show could deprive the president of an outright majority even if it does not take control of parliament.



Government insiders expect a rather poor showing in Sunday’s first-round for Macron’s coalition “Ensemble”, with record numbers of voters seen abstaining.



If Macron’s party and his centrist allies fail to secure a majority, it would be a setback for the president and could prompt messy bill-by-bill deals with rightwing parties in parliament or an unwanted cabinet reshuffle. Likewise, about fourteen of Macron’s ministers are competing in local races and could lose their job if they fail to win a seat.



Voter turnout in mainland France (excluding overseas territories) at 1000 GMT came at 18.4%, the lowest turnout seen in at least 20 years for the first round of parliamentary elections, according to the interior ministry’s data, though it was only 19.2% in the last election at this stage.



Sunday’s first-round vote will decide which candidates face each other in each constituency for a final week of campaigning.



The shape of the new parliament will become clear only after the second round on 19 June.
