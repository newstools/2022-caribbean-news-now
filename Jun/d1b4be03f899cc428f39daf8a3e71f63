Justin Bieber showing early signs of recovery				




Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber is showing early signs of making a recovery after being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, according to a surgeon who specializes in facial paralysis



In a video posted on Instagram, Bieber said he had contracted Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which affected nerves in his ear and face. He noted that his right eye was not blinking.



Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic reconstructive surgeon in Britain and the co-founder of health charity Facial Palsy UK, said about 75% of patients with the syndrome who receive early treatment, including steroids and antivirals, make a full recovery.



“I did notice that Mr Bieber appears to have some evidence of recovery, which is encouraging.”



“With facial paralysis one of the most obvious things is patients are unable to close their eyes fully to blink and they are unable to smile,” Nduka added.



“Before the smile recovers, the first thing that will develop is there is increasingly symmetry in the face at rest. So, the base of the nose often elevates slightly, and the mouth becomes more even. On the video that was shared, I could see some signs that there is some early recovery.”



Bieber has cancelled his world tour series to recover fully.
