Grenadians head to the polls				




Grenadians head to the polls to decide which Mitchell will be their Prime Minister for the next five years.



Incumbent Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of the ruling New National Party (NNP) is hoping to be re-elected for a sixth term as prime minister. He is also seeking a third election victory in a row having won all 15 constituencies in the 2013 and 2018 general elections.  



Meanwhile, Attorney-at-law, Dickon Mitchell, the political leader of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) is hoping to oust the NNP and become Grenada’s next prime minister. 



Both the NNP and NDC have offered up candidates for all 15 seats. In the last two general elections held, the NNP had a clean sweep against NDC.



In its manifesto, NNP is promising to improve housing, jobs, a start-up for small businesses, and further assistance for those in the information, technology, and communication (ICT) sector as an aid to farmers, tourism, and the health sectors.



On the other hand, Dickon Mitchell’s NDC said its vision and plan are for a “sustainable, equitable and prosperous Grenada”.



The OAS Electoral Observation Mission team and a team of election observers from CARICOM are in Grenada to monitor the elections. Polling precincts open at 6 am and will close at 5 pm.
