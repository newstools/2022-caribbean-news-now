Four-day celebration of the Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee wraps up				




The four-day festivities of the Queen’s platinum jubilee concluded on Sunday with a massive lunch gathering across the country and a pageant with a twist.



Thousands of people across the UK participated in hosting the Big Jubilee Lunches, “with events ranging from world record attempts for the longest street party to back garden BBQ’s and everything in between” as part of a “nationwide act of community friendship,” according to the Royal Family’s website.



Despite the wet outdoors, people celebrated the Jubilee with flags festooning streets and picnic tables, and parks were filled with merry gatherings of families and friends for the Queen’s historic jubilee—she is the only monarch to have reached the Platinum Jubilee, making her the longest reigning monarch of the British Empire.



Other countries and nations that are part of the Commonwealth also took part in the historic get together over hearty meals. Lunches were held from Canada to Brazil, New Zealand to Japan and South Africa to Switzerland.



The historic Gold State Carriage led by The Sovereign’s Escort was also paraded during the Platinum Jubilee Pageant. This was the carriage that Queen Elizabeth used at her coronation 70 years ago, and in a nostalgic move showed the Queen’s hologram back when she received the Crown.



The celebration ended with the Queen waving at the Buckingham Palace balcony as the nation sang the National Anthem, ‘God Save the Queen’ and a gospel choir to the sounds of the Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines.



The anniversary of the coronation of the Queen is celebrated every June 2nd with the Trooping of Color to mark the celebration. This year, because of “mobility issues,” the 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth was represented by the Prince of Wales in doing the salute. 



On Saturday, the Queen surprised everyone with an afternoon tea with the Paddington Bear.
