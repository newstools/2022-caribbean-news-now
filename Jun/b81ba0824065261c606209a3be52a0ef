NHC issues warnings for Potential Tropical Storm Two				




The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued tropical storm warnings for parts of the Caribbean ahead of what is likely to become the second Atlantic storm.



“Potential Tropical Cyclone Two” was formed Monday evening east of Trinidad. 



In its 5:00 AM advisory, NHC issued a Tropical Storm Warning for Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada and its dependencies. Meanwhile, a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Bonaire and the Coast of Venezuela from Pedernales to Cumana, including Islas de Margarita, Coche, and Cubagua.



NHC also advised that the Windward Islands, the northern coast of Venezuela, Curacao, Aruba, and the northeastern coast of Colombia should monitor the progress of this system.



The disturbance is moving toward the Southern Windward Islands and is likely to bring heavy rains and gusty winds later today. Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Slight strengthening is forecast during the next few days if the disturbance remains over water.



“We expect the system to cross the southern Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago Tuesday evening into Tuesday night, possibly as a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 39-73 mph,” said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty said.



It is forecasted that Potential Tropical Cyclone Two will bring up to 3 inches of rain in Guadeloupe to St. Lucia, 3 to5 inches of rain in St. Vincent, the Grenadines, and Barbados and 4 to 6 inches of rain in Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago, and northeastern Venezuela.
