Andrew Fahie released on bail				




Former Premier of the Virgin Islands, Andrew Fahie has been released on Monday, after forty-six days in police custody.



Sources said that Fahie posted a one-million-dollar ($1,000,000 US) bail in Florida with a Nebbia Proffer condition attached to half of the funds.



The affidavit document named Albion Hodge, former politician and well-known businessman, as the source of the $500,000 corporate surety bond in place for the former Premier. Hodge is Fahie’s childhood friend.



In addition, the condition of the bail requires Fahie to wear an ankle monitor and his defence attorney can only visit him at his daughters’ apartment in southwest Miami-Dade County. His family is also required to surrender their passports to authorities. 



Fahie also cannot be found within close distance to any transportation centres including bus stops.



Fahie was arrested in the United States on charges of drug smuggling and money laundering. The trial is expected to begin in the middle of next month.
