Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2022				




Leaders from Commonwealth countries are all set for the official opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) at the Kigali Convention Centre in Rwanda.



After the official opening, the Commonwealth heads will attend forums, ministerial meetings, side events and other activities under the theme ‘Delivering a Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming’. At least 35 Heads of State and Government are due to attend the main leaders’ session on Friday. 



The Executive Sessions will take place in private and provide an opportunity for leaders to discuss global and Commonwealth issues. Decisions taken at CHOGM also guide the work programme of the Commonwealth Secretariat.



Then, a Leaders’ Retreat will follow. The Retreat is an informal opportunity for leaders to meet alone, without aides.



The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were welcomed by a selected group of dignitaries during their arrival on Tuesday evening. In 2018, Prince Charles was named by The Queen as her chosen successor to be the head of the Commonwealth.



Another awaited event in the CHOGM 2022 is the appointment of a new Secretary-General. The appointment has become a matter of discussion and created a debate between incumbent Secretary-General Patricia Scotland and Jamaica’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, Kamina Johnson Smith.



Scotland hopes the result will be on her side.



“I am getting a positive response on a daily basis, and more than half of the countries are responding my favour”, said Scotland.



At the end of CHOGM, communiqué at a press conference detailing decisions made by leaders will be issued.



It is the first time the biennial meeting has been held in four years after the 2020 CHOGM was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The last country to host CHOGM in 2018 was the UK and the host country for CHOGM 2024 will be announced at this week’s summit.
