Coast Guard seized $99 million of cocaine in the Caribbean				




US Coast Guard Cutter Thetis’ crew seized more than $99 million worth of cocaine in the Caribbean Sea.



Approximately 5,237 pounds of the illegal narcotic was offloaded at the USCG Base Miami Beach last Friday.



“Interdicting drug traffickers on the open ocean is challenging work and every interdiction is complex and unique,” said Cmdr. Justin Nadolny, commanding officer of Thetis.

Nadolny also said that the offload is a testament to the teamwork and devotion of every crew assigned to carry out the mission, and it showcases the strength of the valuable international partnerships united to combat transnational organized crime.



“The fight against drug cartels in the Caribbean Sea requires unity of effort in all phases from detection, monitoring, and interdictions, to criminal prosecutions by international partners and US Attorneys’ Offices in districts across the nation.”



The Thetis, a 270-foot Famous-class medium endurance cutter, is homeported in Key West and patrols the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, performing counter-drug operations, migrant interdiction operations, search and rescue and fisheries enforcement.
