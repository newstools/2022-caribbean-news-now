Bermuda ends mass vaccination programme				




With approximately 135,000 vaccinations received by Bermuda residents, the Government of Bermuda has announced an end to its mass vaccination programme. 



Minister of Health, Kim Wilson said that over 75% of Bermuda’s total population is fully immunized, and over 85% of the eligible population is either vaccinated or fully immunized, since the vaccination programme began on January 11, 2021.



“It has been a busy eighteen months of vaccinating our community largely for free, with numerous locations around the island. There were no stones unturned to ensure that everyone who wanted to get vaccinated had easy access.”



Wilson added that Bermuda’s COVID-19 vaccination programme surpassed the World Health Organisation’s goal of 70 per cent immunization of a population ahead of the June 30 target.



The Minister attributed the success of the vaccination programme to the awareness campaign done and the Close to Home initiative.



“A hard push was implemented through our Close to Home mobile vaccination programme in neighbourhoods island-wide. With a free minibus service, this programme ensured that transportation to a vaccination centre was not a barrier to getting the vaccine.”



Wilson also recognised the invaluable efforts of all health care workers and volunteers in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.



“On behalf of the Ministry, I cannot thank these professionals enough. Their dedication to the island’s wellbeing is truly stellar. Our success in dealing with COVID-19 was and still is, a community effort. I am truly grateful to everyone involved, and I am also grateful to the many individuals in our community who got vaccinated.”
