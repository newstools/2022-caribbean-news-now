4th of July mass shooting in Chicago				




A gunman on a rooftop opened fire on an Independence Day parade in suburban Chicago on Monday, killing at least six people and wounding at least 30.



The incident happened where residents had staked out great viewing spots for the annual procession. The shooter opened fire around 10:15 a.m. when the parade was about three-quarters through, authorities said.



A guy described as a person of interest in the shooting was arrested Monday evening after an hours-long chase in Highland Park.



Highland Park Police Chief Lou Jogmen said an officer stopped Robert E. Crimo III five miles north of the shooting location, hours after police posted his photo and a photo of his silver Honda Fit and warned the public that he was likely armed and dangerous. 



Police didn’t immediately designate Crimo as a suspect, but designating him as a person of interest was a serious step.



Lake County Major Crime Task Force spokesman Christopher Covelli said several victims died at the scene and one at a hospital. Police haven’t disclosed information about victims or injuries.



Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called it “devastating” that a celebration of America was ruined by an American plague.
