DeNovo produces first gas from Zandolie field in Trinidad				




DeNovo Energy Limited (DeNovo), part of the Proman family of companies, announced the delivery of the first gas from its Zandolie field.



The unmanned minimum facility is DeNovo’s second offshore field development to be completed in Block 1 (a) on the west coast of Trinidad.



“DeNovo has once again proven its commitment to increasing Trinidad’s national gas supply by safely and quickly developing stranded and marginal gas reserves. With an investment of USD 52 MM, Zandolie was completed within 31 months amidst the pandemic,” the statement said.



The Zandolie, a single well conductor-supported platform with a nameplate capacity of 40 MMSCFD is said to be a ground-breaking integration of renewable resources — making it the first design of its kind in Trinidad and Tobago.



DeNovo’s Managing Director, Bryan Ramsumair also noted that this critical milestone in the company’s second field development highlights the drive by the team to constantly improve and learn.



“We pushed ourselves to deliver a greener and more local platform. The result is that the Zandolie platform is a local fabrication which is 100 per cent powered by renewable energy – and which will minimize the carbon footprint of our operations.”



Ramsumair added it is also the company’s intention to on a regular basis keep acquiring access to new acreage for more projects like this.



“With Zandolie, DeNovo is demonstrating that our future energy industry can be done locally and with a lower carbon footprint – both aligned to the country’s development objectives.”
