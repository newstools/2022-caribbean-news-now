Jason Momoa involved in a vehicular accident				




Aquaman and Game of Thrones actor Jason Momoa was involved in a vehicular accident after a motorcyclist collided with his car in Los Angeles.



According to HollywoodLife, a report from the California Highway Patrol states that Momoa was driving eastbound on Old Topanga Canyon Road in a 1970 Oldsmobile, when a motorcycle jumped traffic lanes and crashed head-on into his car.



The impact of the collision ejected the motorcyclist, identified as Vitaliy Avagimyan, and sent him bouncing off Momoa’s windshield. Luckily, the rider landed on his feet and survived with minor injuries. Meanwhile, Momoa got off his vehicle to help Avagimyan and called 911 through a passing driver.



“Mr. Avagimyan was transported by ambulance to Northridge hospital for medical treatment of minor, non-life threatening injuries,” the report read, adding that,” Mr. Momoa was uninjured and remained on scene throughout the investigation.”



The accident remains under investigation but no charges were filed. The actor and his reps have yet to give a statement about the incident.
