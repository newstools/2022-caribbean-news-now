Kwéyòl Heritage Crests 2022				




The Kwéyòl Heritage Foundation (KHF) gives an early glimpse at the 2022 Kwéyòl Heritage Crests.



In a release, the Kwéyòl Heritage Foundation said it collaborated with cultural representatives from each of the four islands, to achieve the unique design of the Crests incorporating not only the flags of Dominica, Saint Lucia, Martinique, and Guadeloupe but the unifying and distinctive Madras fabric that the islands share an affinity with.










KHF will present each Kwéyòl Heritage Crest to government officials and individuals during this year’s various Kwéyòl celebration events.



The foundation also said that For those who have been recognized for Kwéyòl-related achievements for each Island, KHF will contact them shortly to discuss how to receive the Kwéyòl Heritage Lapel pins.
