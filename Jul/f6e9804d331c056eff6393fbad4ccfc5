“Your government, therefore, has decided to extend the deadline for the migration period from a regular passport to the new e-passport for a further six months, December 31 2022.”



Blackmoore added that immigration employees are working day and night to process the applications and asked the public to bear with any inconveniences that may be caused.



He said that as of Tuesday, July 05 2022, the total number of e-passports printed and issued is 31,347.
