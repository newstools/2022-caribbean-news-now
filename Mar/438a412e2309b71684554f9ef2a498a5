Transformation of Dominica Grammar School into a modern campus to begin				




Media Release – Knowledge is power, and education empowers; hence, the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica is incessantly working to revolutionize the education sector in the country.



Apart from the new housing initiatives rolled out, another priority of the Skerrit-led administration is the modernization of the educational facilities in the country. On top of this is the significant transformation of the Dominica Grammar School.



Situated in the capital city of Roseau, the Dominica Grammar School is one of the oldest educational institutions established in 1893.



The Government has signalled the development to go into full swing, spearheaded by MMC Development Ltd., the developing arm of Dubai-based firm Montreal Management Consultants Est (MMCE).

















The new facilities will consist of three (3) major buildings for classes and lectures. Furthermore, another building will be constructed to house the library and administrative offices.



Another highlight of the development will be the state-of-the-art auditorium that can host nearly 500 people.






 







In addition to the climate-resilient structures, the classrooms will be digitally equipped and technology-enhanced to improve students’ learning.



The massive development will also have other areas, which are:
