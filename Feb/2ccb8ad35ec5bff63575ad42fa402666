Scotts Head housing development on the roll				




Media Release – Economic activity in the community of Savanne in Scotts Head has increased as ten (10) local contractors have mobilized and commenced works on site for the first major housing development in the area.











The development is part of the new housing initiative by the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica this 2022.



In the first phase, thirteen (13) three-bedroom standalone homes and one (1) building consisting of four (4) one-bedroom units will be built for families displaced by Hurricane Maria in 2017.



Member of Parliament for the Soufriere Constituency, Denise Charles is over the moon with the development.



“The people of Scotts Head are elated and indeed grateful for this… I look forward to receiving the keys for these beautiful homes to hand over to the families to greatly improve their stand of living and net worth.”











Charles also expressed her gratitude towards MMC Development Ltd. in helping the Government of Dominica fulfil its mission to become the first climate-resilient country.



“The partnership of MMC Development and the Skerrit-led administration has been transforming and improving the lives of our citizens.”



Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit noted that the development is a testament that housing remains the Government’s major priority.



“This is the first phase and a part of a bigger project… this would not solve the problem of the housing situation in Scotts Head, but this is a start, and it is an important start.”



The PM added that his administration would not relent until every Dominican family had a safe place to call home.
