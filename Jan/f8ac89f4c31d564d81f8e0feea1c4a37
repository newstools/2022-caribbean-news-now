Dominica revises COVID-19 isolation and quarantine protocols



Last January 10, the government of Dominica has implemented a new set of protocols and procedures in handling COVID-19 cases.



Dr. David Johnson, Chief Medical Officer of Dominica’s Ministry of Health, made the announcement in a press briefing Wednesday.



In the revised isolation and quarantine protocols, “vaccinated patients who are symptomatic will require an assessment by a health professional approved by the Ministry of Health to determine the need for admission based on the clinical presentation and findings,” Dr. Johnson explained.



The protocol of asymptomatic vaccinated residents to stay at home and isolate if they get a positive result remains unchanged. Unvaccinated patients who are asymptomatic will be allowed to isolate at home, too.



“A red band will be placed on the wrist as it’s currently being done for vaccinated cases. Symptomatic cases will be admitted to the Covid Care Complex or the Dominica-China Friendship Hospital as the case applies,” Dr. Johnson said.



Moreover, those will be asked to be admitted to the hospitals are the following patients: (1) individuals who are aged 55 years and older with chronic medical conditions, (2) individuals with underlying medical conditions, and (3) individuals who might break protocols if sent home.



As of Wednesday, Dominica has recorded 607 active cases of COVID-19 in the island.
